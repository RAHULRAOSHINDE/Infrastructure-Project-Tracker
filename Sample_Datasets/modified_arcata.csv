Phase One of the AWTP project will be the City’s largest capital improvement project at an anticipated $54 million in construction costs.

Construction activities include, but are not limited to, a new ultraviolet (UV) disinfection system to replace the current chlorine-based system and reduce associated disinfection byproducts, a new electrical building, upgrades and retrofits to existing facilities, oxidation pond aerators, extensive new sewer piping and electrical duct work, a new pump station to the Enhancement Marshes and a new treated effluent outfall located at the Brackish Marsh.

Funding for this project, a project funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has been provided in full or in part under the California’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which is capitalized through a variety of funding sources, including grants from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and state bond proceeds through an agreement with the State Water Resources Control Board. Additional funding for UV equipment has been provided in part by a HUD Community Development Block Grant (CDBG).

The City has received all environmental permits and approvals for the project and has a multidisciplinary team of consultants and city staff to monitor construction activities and minimize environmental impacts in and around the City’s core wastewater treatment facilities and the publicly accessible enhancement marshes. Sections of the Arcata Marsh & Wildlife Sanctuary may be temporarily closed during pre-construction bird, amphibian, and botanical surveys, during pre-construction vegetation removal, during construction and while conducting post-construction mitigation measures. Please do not remove any staking or flagging found in the project area as it is likely either marking an area cleared by biologist or an area of concern to avoid during construction. Construction activities will be ongoing for a duration of three years, with an anticipated end date in December 2025. 

We thank you for your ongoing support and understanding during the construction period.

More detailed information about the project can be found here.","Phase One of the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility Improvement Project has completed our first of three years of construction.

The City will begin testing our new treated wastewater effluent Outfall 003, located at the Brackish Marsh on South I Street at the crossing of the Bay Trail, starting Friday, December 8, 2023, weather permitting. 

 The Outfall consists of two discharge options, one pipe under the water surface and one above the water surface. Visitors to the Marsh may see water bubbling and movement under the surface of the water, or water may be discharged from the pipe above in the newly constructed outflow area. Treated wastewater cycling through the Arcata Marsh and out to Humboldt Bay provides a myriad of benefits for local wildlife and habitats. 

Beginning May, 2024 construction crews will start rehabilitation of primary clarifier 2. Crews will bore a new 10” bypass pipe across the plant grounds to Ox Pond 2 and start recoating the West Chlorine Contact Chamber. While the Bay Trail is closed from April 22 to May 22, crews will install new electrical duct-banks, manholes and demo the Butcher Slough wood bridge. Once the wood bridge work is complete, the existing main pipeline will be re-coated and the new metal bridge will be repaired.
